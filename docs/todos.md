- Tests for controllers and services
- API definitions generation (for client/backoffice)
- Security audit: review signature logic
- Disputes: finish release/refund
- Disputes: add support partial resolution (funds split among participants)
- Monorepo consolidation (dependencies, CI)
- DX: working docker-compose for local development
- Backoffice features? (auth, requests and contracts management)
- Client usable as drop-in component for third party integrations? (requires work on the RPC interface and some UI)
- Client chat? (nostr)
- Check and review domain-specific semantics (ie: contracts, settlement, execution, ...) to match the one used at Ark
